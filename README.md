From a given folder, this script will create a "renamed_pictures" folder and remove all "VID-", "VID_", "IMG-", "IMG_" from the file names.

```r
rename_samsung_from_whatsapp(
  folder = "C:/Users/titi/Downloads/WhatsApp"
)
```

rename_samsung will add either "IMG_" or "VID_" to the beginning of the file name. It will also create a folder called "renamed_pictures" in the given folder and move the renamed files there.

```r
rename_samsung(
  folder = "C:/Users/titi/Downloads/WhatsApp"
)
```
